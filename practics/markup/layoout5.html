  <div class="static">static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.</div>
  <div class="relative1">relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.</div>
  <div class="relative2">Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</div>
  <div class="fixed">Hello! Don't pay attention to me yet.</div>
  <div class="relative">This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; its absolutely-positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.
    <div class="absolute">This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned relative to its parent.</div>
  </div>
